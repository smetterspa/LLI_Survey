# Description
We developed and implemented two surveys with customers of a large life insurer, LLI. As is standard in academic work using commercial data, LLI is a fictional name, as the data provider LLI wishes to remain anonymous in exchange for providing this unique data. LLI is a large U.S. life insurer that regularly receives an A.M. Best Company rating of A++. LLI life insurance is widely marketed to the general U.S. population. Over the years, LLI has developed considerable expertise in surveying its clients, including how to word questions to avoid confusion. The first survey ("New Buyers Survey") was delivered to all customers from LLI who purchased term life insurance between October 2013 and November 2017. (We only survey those who purchased term policies because LLI permanent policies include a unique type of universal life policy that is being used by LLI's wealth management group as a tax-efficient investment vehicle for people who have maxed out their tax preferred (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), or IRA) contributions.) The second survey ("Lapsers Survey") was delivered to all customers from LLI who lapsed on their life insurance policies between January 2012 and November 2017. Survey data was provided in support of the academic paper, _Gottlieb, Daniel and Kent Smetters (Forthcoming). "Lapse-Based Insurance." Conditionally Accepted, The American Economic Review._ More details, including the entire list of survey questions, is provided in Section 3 and Appendix B of that paper. Data is passcode protected until the academic paper is published, at which time the passcode will be removed. However, the passcode and computation code has been transmitted to the AER's data replication team as part of its validation exercise prior to publication.
